            BREAKING CHANGE:

            This release removes the requirement of inheriting from the PeekLockMessage class in order to gain
            control over peek lock messages. The class itself has been removed entirely, but there are effectively
            no other external API changes. Upon upgrading to this version of the library the only change you
            should have to make is to remove PeekLockMessage as a base class wherever it was being used.

            Another positive side effect of this change is that you may also be able to remove references to
            the Obvs.AzureServiceBus library and all of its dependencies from some of your projects since it
            no longer requires polution of your domain type hierarchy.
